Hi! As you very likely already know, my name is Emanuele and I am a human
being. As you might not know, I work as a [Site Reliability
Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) at
[Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation)
focusing on Traffic Engineering for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites. I have
been a member of the [Debian GNU/Linux Project](https://www.debian.org/) since
2003. Let's walk through a list of links about myself of debatable importance.

* [Projects on GitHub](https://github.com/ema)
* [My Wikimedia staff page](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:ERocca_(WMF)) (WARNING: includes picture!)
* [Debian packages overview](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=ema@debian.org)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/91778/ema) and [Super User](http://superuser.com/users/144879/ema) profiles
* [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/emarocca/)

In decreasing order of likelihood, you are here because:
1. You are a robot. Hello friendly robot!
2. You have attended a presentation of mine and I told you to come here for the
   slides. Hopefully the talk was good! Click on [talks]({{< relref "talks.md" >}}).
3. We know each other and you have searched for my web page. Hi there! Sorry
   about the web page.
4. You want to send me an email, but do not know my email address. That is "ema
   at linux dot it". If you want to send an encrypted message, here is my [PGP
   key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xD5085A0750FDB7A3).
5. You were looking for the Italian football player named Emanuele Rocca and
   ended up here instead. I am not saying that this is unlikely (on the
   contrary!) but I am sure that those looking for the player have realised their
   mistake very long ago.
