Hi, this is Emanuele. Welcome to my little corner of the web.

I have been a member of the [Debian
Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#Organization) for about [20
years](https://nm.debian.org/legacy/process/13389/) now. My current focus is
the [ARM Ports](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/), and in the past I worked on
the [SPARC Port](https://www.debian.org/ports/sparc/). I've also been a member
of the [Xfce](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianXfceGroup) and
[Python](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PythonTeam) teams.

Other things I'm proud of in no particular order: I wrote a configuration
management system called [Pets](https://github.com/ema/pets), an article for
Linux Weekly News about [SystemTap and bpftrace](https://lwn.net/Articles/852112/),
and discovered a vulnerability in ppp:
[CVE-2015-3310](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3228).
