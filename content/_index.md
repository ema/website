Hi! My name is Emanuele and I am a human being. I work as a [Site Reliability
Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) at
[Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation)
focusing on Traffic Engineering for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites. I am
also a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Developer. Throughout the years (I
started in 2003!) I have been involved in various areas of Debian, currently
mostly maintaining [SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki).
