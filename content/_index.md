Hi! My name is Emanuele and I'm a [Site Reliability
Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) at
[Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation)
focusing on Traffic Engineering for Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites. I also
contribute to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as a Developer. Throughout the
years (I started in 2003!) I have been involved in various areas of Debian,
currently mostly maintaining
[SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki).
