Hi! My name is Emanuele and I'm a Systems Development Engineer at
[AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) focusing on the hosts
that provide the underlying infrastracture for
[EC2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud). I also
contribute to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) as a Developer. Throughout the
years (I started in 2003!) I have been involved in various areas of Debian,
currently mostly maintaining
[SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki). Among the things I'm proud
of, I wrote an article for Linux Weekly News about [SystemTap and
bpftrace](https://lwn.net/Articles/852112/), and discovered a vulnerability in
ppp: [CVE-2015-3310](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3228).
