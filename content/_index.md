Hi! My name is Emanuele and I'm a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Developer.
Throughout the years (I started in 2003!) I have been involved in various areas
of Debian. Currently, I'm a member of the [Debian Python
Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PythonTeam) and I maintain
[SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki). Among the things I'm proud
of, I wrote an article for Linux Weekly News about [SystemTap and
bpftrace](https://lwn.net/Articles/852112/), and discovered a vulnerability in
ppp: [CVE-2015-3310](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3228).
