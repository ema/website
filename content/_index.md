Hi, this is Emanuele. Welcome to my little corner of the web.

Among the things I'm proud of, I wrote a configuration management system called
[Pets](https://github.com/ema/pets), an article for Linux Weekly News about
[SystemTap and bpftrace](https://lwn.net/Articles/852112/), and discovered a
vulnerability in ppp:
[CVE-2015-3310](https://www.debian.org/security/2015/dsa-3228).
